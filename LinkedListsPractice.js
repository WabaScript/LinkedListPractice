// Why use a Linked List? 
// A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of structs, Nodes, which are linked
// to one another via pointers.
// Node consists of the value(any data type) you wish to store and a reference(pointer)
// A linked list trumps arrays in it's dynamic efficiency. 
// They are resizable and performant in insertion and deletion.
// However, cons include slow reads(not sequential in memory, aka,you must traverse to find) and takes up more space(storage).
