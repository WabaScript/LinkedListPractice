# Linked List Practice
Practicing with Linked Lists
 - Initialize Nodes and Linked Lists
 - Insert First(head) Node
 - Insert Last Node
 - Insert Node at Specified Index
 - Get Node Data at Specfied Index
 - Remove Node at Specified Index
 - Clear list *will orphan data in memory*
 - Get All List Data
 
# Why use a Linked List? 
<ul>
  <li>A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of structs, Nodes, which are linked to one another via pointers.</li>
  <li>Node consists of the value(any data type) you wish to store and a reference(pointer).</li>
  <li>A linked list trumps arrays in it's dynamic efficiency.</li>
  <li>They are resizable and performant in insertion and deletion.</li>
  <li>However, cons include slow reads(not sequential in memory, aka,you must traverse to find) and takes up more space(storage).</li>
</ul>
